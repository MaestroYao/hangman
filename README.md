# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
The aim of this implementation is to develop my programming techniques as well as get an understanding of the use of GitHub and the workflow it offers.
In this readme, my aim is to document the process I undertook in each Milestone to develop my version of the game

## Milestone 1
In this Milestone I had to first set up a Github repository for the game files. This was easily done by the AiCore webpage which created it automatically.
